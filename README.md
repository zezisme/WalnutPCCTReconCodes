# WalnutPCCTReconCodes

This repository provides MATLAB code for loading, correcting, reconstructing, and performing spectral analysis on projection data from the **Walnut Photon-Counting CT (PCCT) Dataset**, acquired using a custom micro-cone-beam PCCT system. The dataset includes multi-energy raw projections of 15 walnut samples, along with calibration tables and scanning geometry information.

## 🔧 System Requirements

Due to the large volume of high-resolution projection data and memory-intensive reconstruction tasks, the following system configuration is recommended:

- MATLAB R2024a or later
- 64 GB RAM or more
- GPU with CUDA support and ≥8 GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2080 or above)
- Windows 64-bit OS (precompiled MEX files provided for this platform)

---

## 📦 Dependencies

This codebase is based on the [TIGRE Toolbox](https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE), an open-source GPU-accelerated CT reconstruction library supporting FDK and iterative algorithms.

### 🔁 Quick Installation

To automatically install and configure TIGRE, **simply run** the requirements.m file:

```matlab
requirements
```

## 🚀 Core Functionalities
### 1. 🌀 Projection-Domain Correction & Reconstruction
Run the WalnutDataRecon.m to reconstruct high, low, and total energy bin images with optional artifact correction:
You can configure:
- Reconstruction algorithm (FDK, SART, MLEM, etc.)
- Angular sampling (full/sparse views)
- Energy bin (Total / High / Low)
- Whether to apply:
  - Non-uniformity correction (STEPC)
  - Ring artifact removal
  - 3D-TV denoising
### 2. 🧪 Image-Domain Spectral Reconstruction
For material decomposition and virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI), run the WalnutSpectralRecon.m
Set monoenergetic image energies via:
```matlab
recon_para.WalnutVMI_E = 10:10:80;
```
Reconstructed results include:
- Walnut shell and pulp decomposition
- Energy-dependent VMI volumes

## 📊 Example Use Cases
- **Deep learning model training** for material decomposition or sparse-view reconstruction
- **Detector calibration studies** (e.g., bad pixel correction, ring artifact correction)
- **Virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI)** synthesis for contrast analysis
- **Spectral CT algorithm benchmarking** using real PCCT data
